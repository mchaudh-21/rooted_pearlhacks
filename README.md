# Rooted: How to be Green on a Budget

## Inspiration
With Rooted, we wanted to create a site that provides an incentive to live more sustainably. The problem that comes with this is that many products that are advertised as sustainable alternatives tend to be more expensive, therefore less accessible for those who live on a budget. We want Rooted to provide that accessibility by providing cost-efficient and eco-friendly products everyone can invest in.
## What it does
Rooted essentially provides a list of eco-friendly alternative products to everyday items such as supplies for bathrooms, homes, offices, etc. This list can be filtered down based on how much money you want or are able to spend and what you want to spend money on. Once you have that list, you can choose to save/store the products that interest you in a favorites page just by clicking the heart on each product card. The card itself consists of a product picture, price range, sustainability rating, and also a button for you to click if you actually bought this item. The profile page of the user will contain basic personal information and your "eco-score" (similar to fico score) which is determined by the number of products you buy as well as their sustainability rating. The more items you buy and the better the ratings are, the higher the score.
## How we built it
We utilized HTML and CSS programming to create the pages and stylize them. We also created a sample database with products and their alternatives to implement in the HTML website.
## Challenges we ran into
Formatting/styling the pages of the website in the way we visioned our project was definitely a struggle and we did end up making a few compromises given the time constraint we had. We also chose to mainly focus on front-end development as we felt we could accomplish more with this in terms of presenting a cohesive idea.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we came up with a cohesive idea and a website that provides a good picture of our vision.
## What we learned
We learned that although HTML is a fairly easy language to grasp, the smallest syntax error can definitely mess everything up.
## What's next for Rooted
In terms of our idea, we were concerned about how we help users hold themselves accountable as opposed to just clicking the bought button to gain more points. So, we want to award users with coupons after they have bought a certain amount of sustainable products. Part of this idea will rely on the trust of users who were willing to sign up for this website for a good reason, to begin with. What we also want to do is create a community in which friends can track each other's progress or eco-score as well as see what products they have bought.
